# memcached-operator

The goal of this repo is to create a simple operator
that closely matches [operator sdk tutoral](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/tutorial/)
with tests.

## Note

The memcached-operator does not include Ginkgo tests, or live testing
with KinD. This repo is setup for easy experimentation, and sharing
of ideas. 

See added tests: 


## Reference

Reference the [azure-databricks-operator](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-databricks-operator) and all the
advanced testing.
